Connected triples:
```
1,2,3
1,2,4
1,2,5
1,4,2
1,4,5
2,1,4
2,3,5
2,4,5
2,5,3
2,5,4
3,2,4
3,2,5
3,5,4
4,2,5
```
Total number of connected triples = 14

Triangles in the network:
```
1,2,4
2,3,5
2,4,5
```
Total number of triangles = 14

Clustering Coefficient, $C = 3/14$ 

Path length between nodes:
$$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\hline
d(x_1,x_2)&1&2&3&4&5\\\hline
1&-&1&2&1&2\\
2&1&-&1&1&1\\
3&2&1&-&2&1\\
4&1&1&2&-&1\\
5&2&1&1&1&-
\end{array}$$

Average Path Length, $L = 26/20 = 1.3$

####**b)**

Figure 9.13.1

Since each half of the triples are arcs of a circle and the other half of the triples are triangles, $C = 0.5$.

For each node, it can reach four other nodes in 1 step and the other three nodes in 2 steps. As such, the average path length is given by $1*4 + 2*3 / 7 = 10/7 = 1.4285714286$

Figure 9.13.2

Since the expected number of long ranged links is 1,

$0.5ncp = 1\\0.5(8)(4)p = 1 \\p = 0.0625$

$$C = \frac{3(c-2)}{4(c-1) + 8cp + 4cp^2}\\
=\frac{3(2)}{4(3) + 8*4*0.625 + 4*4*0.625^2}\\
6 /(12 + 2 + 0.0625) = 0.4266666$$

$$L = \frac{log(ncp)}{c^2p} = \frac{log(8*4*0.0625)}{4^2*0.0625} = log(2) = 0.3010299957$$

Both the clustering coefficient as well as the average path length decreased as a result of the additional path in the regular graph. However, as expected, the clustering coefficient decreased at a much slower rate compared to that of the average path length as the graph is a Watts-Strogatz Graph.
