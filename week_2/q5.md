###Exercise 5. VCG auction
#####Find the prices obtained by a VCG mechanism for the bidders and items below (the numbers above the edges are the biddersâ€™ valuations).

$$\begin{array}{|c|ccccc|}\hline
v_{ij}&j=1&j=2
\\\hline
i=1&10&2\\
i=2&3&8\\
i=3&5&6\\
i=4&7&9\\
\hline\end{array}$$

Maximise $\sum_{(ij)}v_{ij}$

Best matching obtained is given by [(1,1),(4,2)], with a valuation of 10 + 9 = 19

$V = v_{ij} - \hat V_{i \leftarrow j} = 19$

Without bidder 1, the best matching is given by [(2,2),(4,1)], with a valuation of 8 + 7 = 15. This implies that 

- bidder 1 has caused bidder 2 $8 worth of damage 
- bidder 1 has caused bidder 4 $-2 worth of damage

$\hat V_{1 \leftarrow 1} = 19 - 10 = 9$

$p_{11} = V_{no\ 1} - \hat V_{1 \leftarrow 1} = 15 - 9 = 6 = 8 + -2$

As such, bidder 1 would have to pay $6.

Without bidder 4, the best matching is given by [(1,1),(2,2)], with a valuation of 10 + 8 = 18. This implies that 

- bidder 4 has caused bidder 2 $8 worth of damage 

$\hat V_{1 \leftarrow 1} = 19 - 9 = 10$

$p_{42} = V_{no\ 1} - \hat V_{1 \leftarrow 1} = 18 - 10 = 8 = 8$
