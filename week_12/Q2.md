##Question 2

Let $t$ refer to the value of the transmission round.

At $t=1$, $cwind = 1$, and doubles at each transmission round. This shows that the algorithm is in slow-start mode.

At $t=7$, $cwind$ stops doubling, and instead starts increasing linearly by $1$ for each transmission round. This shows that the algorithm had changed to congestion avoidance mode. We can also infer that $ssthreshold â‰¥ 32$.

At $t = 17$, $cwind$ suddenly halves its value from $42$ to $21$. This shows that a Triple Duplicate Ack was encountered. It can therefore be inferred that after this event, $cwind = ssthreshold = 21$. After this event, the algorithm is visibly in congestion avoidance mode, since it increases $cwind$ linearly for every transmission round.

At $t = 23$, $cwind$ suddenly drops from $26$ back to $1$, and can be seen to be in slow-start mode after that. This indicates that a Timeout event had occurred. Thus, at $t=23$, $cwind = 1$ and $ssthreshold = 11$ (half of $21$).
