##Question 1

For $n$ bottom users,
Constraints:
$$
x_A + x_i \le C \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
x_A, x_i\ge 0 \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**1**

Substituting $log(x)$ with $ln(x)$ since they differ by a fixed proportion.

For $n$ bottom users,

**Social welfare function:**
$$\sum_{i=1}^n ln(x_i) + ln(x_A)$$

Because $ln(x)$ is an increasing function in $x$, it is always favourable for social welfare to increase an $x$ value if we do not need to decrease another $x$ value, hence the constraints are satisfied at equality and we have:

$$
x_i = C - x_A \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**Social welfare function:**
$$
ln(x_A) + n \, ln(C - x_A) = ln(x_A(C - x_A)^n)
$$

Because $ln$ is an increasing function, this is equivalent to maximising $x_A(C - x_A)^n$.

Differentiating gives
$$(C-x_A)^n - nx_A(C-x_A)^{n-1} = (C - (n + 1)x_A)(C - x_A)^{n-1}$$

This implies stationary points at $x_A = C, \frac{C}{n+1}$

Inspection shows that it is not reasonable for $A$ to use all of the bandwidth as we can decrease $x_A$ by a small amount to get a big utility gain from the other users and $x_A = C$ is actually the minimum.

 Thus the optimal allocation is
$$x_A = \frac{1}{n+1}C\\
x_i = \frac{n}{n+1}C$$

which is the proportional fairness discussed in class. For the $n=2$ case, this gives

$$x_A = \frac{1}{3}C\\
x_i = \frac{2}{3}C$$

**2**

Because $arctan(x)$ is an increasing function in $x$, it is always favourable for social welfare to increase an $x$ value if we do not need to decrease another $x$ value, hence the constraints are satisfied at equality and we have:

$$
x_i = C - x_A \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**Social welfare function:**

$$
arctan(x_A) + n(arctan(C - x_A))
$$

Differentiating with respect to $x_A$ gives

$$
\frac{1}{1 + {x_A}^2} - \frac{n}{1 + {(C - x_A)}^2}
$$

Solving for stationary points,

$$
\begin{align}
1 + {(C - x_A)}^2 - n - n{x_A}^2 &= 0\\
1 + C^ 2 -2Cx_A + {x_A}^2 - n - n{x_A}^2 &= 0\\
(1 - n){x_A}^2 - 2Cx_A - n + C^2 + 1 &= 0 \\
x_A = \frac{2C \pm \sqrt{4C^2 - 4(1-n)(-n + C^2 + 1)} }{2(1-n)}\\
x_A = \frac{C \pm \sqrt{-1 + n(C^2 + 2) - n^2} }{1-n}\\
x_A = \frac{C}{1 - n} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-1 + nC^2 + 2n - n^2}{1- 2n + n^2}}\\
x_A = \frac{C}{1 - n} \pm \sqrt{\frac{nC^2}{(1- n)^2} - 1}\\
\end{align}
$$

Since $x_A \ge 0$,  social welfare is maximised at $x_A = \frac{C}{1 - n} - \sqrt{\frac{nC^2}{(1- n)^2} - 1}$.

For $n = 2$, $x_A = -C + \sqrt{2C^2 -1}$

**3**

For $n$ bottom users,

**Social welfare function:**
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + x_A$$

For the same reason as before, the constraints are satisfied at equality, once again giving

$$
x_i = C - x_A \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**Social welfare function:**
$$n(C - x_A) + x_A = nC - (n-1)x_A$$

The stationary point of this function is at $x_A = 0$. This is the maximum and it makes sense because allocating 1 unit of traffic from $A$ reaps a social utility of 1 unit for every bottom user, thus $A$ should not be allocated any traffic.

 Thus the optimal allocation for all $n$ is
$$x_A = 0\\
x_i = C$$


**4**

The allocation in 3 is unfair for any number of users $n$ because $x_A$ will never get any bandwidth if social welfare is maximised, whereas the allocation in 1 is unfair when $n$ is very large because the $x_A$ will be extremely small (quickly approaching 0 as $n$ approaches infinity).
