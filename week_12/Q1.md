##Question 1

For $n$ bottom users,
Constraints:
$$
x_A + x_i \le C \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
x_A, x_i\ge 0 \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

Substituting $log(x)$ with $ln(x)$ since they differ by a fixed proportion.

For $n$ bottom users,

**Social welfare function:**
$$\sum_{i=1}^n ln(x_i) + ln(x_A)$$

Because $ln(x)$ is an increasing function in $x$, it is always favourable for social welfare to increase an $x$ value if we do not need to decrease another $x$ value, hence the constraints are satisfied at equality and we have:

$$
x_i = C - x_A \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**Social welfare function:**
$$
ln(x_A) + n \, ln(C - x_A) = ln(x_A(C - x_A)^n)
$$

Because $ln$ is an increasing function, this is equivalent to maximising $x_A(C - x_A)^n$.

Differentiating gives
$$(C-x_A)^n - nx_A(C-x_A)^{n-1} = (C - (n + 1)x_A)(C - x_A)^{n-1}$$

This implies stationary points at $x_A = C, \frac{C}{n+1}$

Inspection shows that it is not reasonable for $A$ to use all of the bandwidth as we can decrease $x_A$ by a small amount to get a big utility gain from the other users and $x_A = C$ is actually the minimum.

 Thus the optimal allocation is
$$x_A = \frac{1}{n+1}C\\
x_i = \frac{n}{n+1}C$$

which is the proportional fairness discussed in class. For the $n=2$ case, this gives

$$x_A = \frac{1}{3}C\\
x_i = \frac{2}{3}C$$

For $n$ bottom users,

**Social welfare function:**
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + x_A$$

For the same reason as before, the constraints are satisfied at equality, once again giving

$$
x_i = C - x_A \, \forall i \in \{1,2...,n\}\\
$$

**Social welfare function:**
$$n(C - x_A) + x_A = nC - (n-1)x_A$$

The stationary point of this function is at $x_A = 0$. This is the maximum and it makes sense because allocating 1 unit of traffic from $A$ reaps a social utility of 1 unit for every bottom user, thus $A$ should not be allocated any traffic.

 Thus the optimal allocation for all $n$ is
$$x_A = 0\\
x_i = C$$
