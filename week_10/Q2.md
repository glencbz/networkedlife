##Question 2

**1**
Without statistical multiplexing, one assumes that all users are busy all the time. $N_d$ is thus the maximum value of $N$ that satisfies $N <= C$, i.e. $N_d = C$.

**2**

Since $N_d = C$,
$$P(X > C) < \gamma$$

Using
$$
\begin{align}
P(X > C) &= 1 - P(X \le C)\\
&= 1 - (\sum^C_{i=0}p^i(1 - p)^{N_s - i}
\begin{pmatrix}N_s\\i\end{pmatrix})
\end{align}
$$

We select the highest value of $N_s$ that satisfies this relationship.

Given $p = 0.1, \gamma = 0.01$,
for $C = 10,20,30$, $N_s = 50,  122, 301$. Thus $N_s$ grows more quickly than $C$ and a link of $2C$ accommodates more than $2N_s$ users.

$\sum^{N_s}_{i= N_d +1}P(X = i)$ is the probability that the link is congested.

**3**

For a link of capacity $2C$, $N_{s2} > 2N_s$. This is greater than two links of capacity, $C$ which can accommodate $N_s + N_s = 2N_s$.

```import math

def nCr(n, r):
    f = math.factorial
    return f(n) / f(r) / f(n-r)

def pXC(Ns, k, p):
    return (p ** k) * ((1- p) ** (Ns - k)) * nCr(Ns, k)

def pXgeC(Ns, C, p):
    p_masses = tuple(pXC(Ns, i, p) for i in range(0, C+1))
    return 1 - sum(p_masses)

def computeNs(C, p, gamma):
    ns = C
    while True:
        if pXgeC(ns, C, p) > gamma:
            break
        ns += 1
    return ns - 1

for i in [10,20,30]:
    print computeNs(i, 0.1, 0.01)
	# 50, 122, 200
```
